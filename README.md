# CS-255-DriverPass
This DriverPass project required me to design a system for a driver training company that allowed for in person and online participation from students and instructors alike. The client was the DriverPass company itself, who was looking for a robust online system to better manage their data and workflow. I thought I did a great job at designing the system's most important entities, and their relationships through UML diagrams. If I could go back and rework a part of the project, it would be for me to add in methods and better show inheritance in the system design.
I translated the user's needs of online scheduling, progress tracking, and administrator access. Meeting these user needs is important because it allows the system to be user friendly, both on the administrator and customer side, allowing for overall system success for DriverPass.
I think my approach to software design falls mostly onto understand what the user REALLY needs. Depicting these needs in a diagram and breaking it down to the simplest terms is one of my strongest attributes. In the future, working with a team, I would like to introduce frequent feedback cycles to ensure the client is happy, and the UI is easy to use.
